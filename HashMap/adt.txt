HashMap:
    size(): Returns the number of entries in M.
    isEmpty(): Returns a boolean indicating whether M is empty.
    get(k): Returns the value v associated with key k, if such an entry exists; otherwise returns null.
    put(k, v): If M does not have an entry with key equal to k, then adds entry (k, v) to M and returns null; else, replaces with v the existing value of the entry with key equal to k and returns the old value.
    remove(k): Removes from M the entry with key equal to k, and returns its value; if M has no such entry, then returns null.
    keySet(): Returns an iterable collection containing all the keys stored in M.
    values(): Returns an iterable collection containing all the values of entries stored in M (with repetition if multiple keys map to the same value).
    entrySet(): Returns an iterable collection containing all the key-value entries in M.
