BinaryTree:
    setRoot(node): sets the node as the root of the tree, an error is thrown if the tree is not empty
    getRoot(): returns the root node or null if the tree is empty
    addLeft(parent, child): adds the child node to the left of the parent node, an error is thrown if the left already has a node
    addRight(parent, child): adds the child node to the right of the parent node, an error is thrown if the right already has a node
    isEmpty(): returns a boolean indicating whether the tree is empty
    isRoot(node): returns a boolean indicating whether the node is the root node
    isLeaf(node): returns a boolean indicating whether the node has no children
    depth(): returns the depth of the tree (number of layers)
    height(): returns the total number of nodes in the tree, including the root node
