    addLeft(parent, child): adds the child node to the left of the parent node, an error is thrown if the left already has a node
    addRight(parent, child): adds the child node to the right of the parent node, an error is thrown if the right already has a node
    remove(node): removes the node and all of its descendants
    isEmpty(): returns a boolean indicating whether the tree is empty
    depth(): returns the depth of the tree (number of layers)
    depth(node): returns the depth of the node
    size(): returns the total number of nodes in the tree, including the root node
