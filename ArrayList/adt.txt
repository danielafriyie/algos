List:
    size(): Returns the number of elements in the list.
    isEmpty(): Returns a boolean indicating whether the list is empty.
    get(i): Returns the element of the list having index i; an error condition occurs if i is not in range [0, size() − 1].
    set(i, e): Replaces the element at index i with e, and returns the old element that was replaced; an error condition occurs if i is not in range [0, size() − 1].
    add(i, e): Inserts a new element e into the list so that it has index i, moving all subsequent elements one index later in the list; an error condition occurs if i is not in range [0, size()].
    remove(i): Removes and returns the element at index i, moving all subse- quent elements one index earlier in the list; an error condition occurs if i is not in range [0, size() − 1].
